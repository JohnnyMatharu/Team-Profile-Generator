# Description
When employees data is hard to manage for a place like an upscale restaurant, a staffing agency, or a new construction site where many temporary workers work, a need arises to build a web application which is this, to make record keeping not only easier, but prettier, well-organized, and much faster to update

This application is used to add information for employees in small sections, and features of every single box space is different and unique. User inputs and information is displayed on HTML in small sections unique and special for each employee. Contructor functions were used to group common information into classes

Tools used HTML, CSS, Object Oriented Programming, Node, and NPM
